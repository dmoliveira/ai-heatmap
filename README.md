# AI Heatmap

## 📌 Overview
AI Heatmap is a simple script that generates a heatmap based on the frequency of your conversations with ChatGPT throughout the year. It helps visualize your AI interactions over time.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Export Your ChatGPT Conversations**  
   - Go to **Settings** → **Data Controls** → **Export** in your ChatGPT account.  
2. **Extract the Data**  
   - Unzip the exported file and place it inside a folder named `data`.  
3. **Set the Conversation Folder**  
   - Ensure `conversation_folder` points to the extracted data directory.  
4. **Adjust Your Timezone**  
   - Update `local_tz` with your local timezone to correctly timestamp each conversation.
